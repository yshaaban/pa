# Process Algebra Verifier

## Overview

A comprehensive TypeScript implementation of a process algebra verification system, supporting multiple semantic models and verification techniques for analyzing concurrent and distributed systems.

## Features

### Core Capabilities

- Labelled Transition System (LTS) infrastructure
- Multiple process term representations
- Structural Operational Semantics (SOS) engine
- Advanced equivalence checking techniques

### Supported Equivalence Relations

- Trace Equivalence
- Bisimulation Equivalence
- Testing Equivalence
- Failures Equivalence

### Semantic Models

- CCS (Calculus of Communicating Systems)
- CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes)
- ACP (Algebra of Communicating Processes)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/process-algebra-verifier.git
cd process-algebra-verifier
npm install
```

## Usage

### Basic Process Term Creation

```typescript
import { PrefixTerm, ChoiceTerm } from "./core/process-term";

// Create a simple prefix term
const prefixTerm = new PrefixTerm("a", new PrefixTerm("b", null));

// Create a choice term
const choiceTerm = new ChoiceTerm(prefixTerm, new PrefixTerm("c", null));
```

### Equivalence Checking

```typescript
import { EquivalenceChecker, EquivalenceType } from './verification/equivalence-checker';
import { ProcessLTS } from './core/lts';

const lts = new ProcessLTS('initial');
const checker = new EquivalenceChecker(lts);

const term1 = // ... create first process term
const term2 = // ... create second process term

const areEquivalent = checker.checkEquivalence(
  term1,
  term2,
  EquivalenceType.BISIMULATION
);
```

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

## Theoretical Foundations

This project implements process algebra verification techniques based on:

- Structural Operational Semantics (SOS)
- Behavioral equivalence theories
- Concurrency models from seminal works by Robin Milner, Tony Hoare, and others

## Research and Verification Goals

- Analyze concurrent system properties
- Verify communication protocols
- Model distributed system behaviors
- Detect potential deadlocks and race conditions
