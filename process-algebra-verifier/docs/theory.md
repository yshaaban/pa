These diagrams provide a comprehensive visualization of the theoretical foundations underlying process algebras and their relationships. They serve as a reference for understanding the mathematical concepts and their practical implementation in the verification system.

## Key Insights

1. The semantic domains (operational, denotational, algebraic) provide different but complementary views of process behavior.
2. Behavioral equivalences form a lattice structure with increasing discriminative power.
3. Process operators can be classified based on their role in system description.
4. SOS rules and their formats determine important theoretical properties.
5. Different process algebra models (CCS, CSP, ACP) emphasize different aspects of concurrent system description.
6. Verification methods combine different approaches for comprehensive system analysis.

This theoretical foundation guides the implementation of the process algebra verifier, ensuring that the practical tools correctly reflect the mathematical theory.
