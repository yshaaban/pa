/**
 * Core Labelled Transition System (LTS) Infrastructure
 * 
 * This module provides the fundamental types and classes for representing
 * Labelled Transition Systems (LTS), which are the semantic foundation for
 * process algebras. An LTS consists of:
 * 
 * - States: Representing process configurations
 * - Actions: Representing possible behaviors (visible and internal)
 * - Transitions: Representing state changes through actions
 * 
 * The implementation supports:
 * - Efficient transition storage and lookup
 * - Bidirectional transition traversal
 * - Action complement handling for synchronization
